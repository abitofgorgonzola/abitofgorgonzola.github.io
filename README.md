This is a testing site that serves to further my understanding of GitHub so that I can edit [Tumble Network](@tumblenet) [Home Beta](http://github.com/tumblenet/beta.tumblenet.tk) more appropriately. My mentor is user [@tumble1999], I am his padawan and from [Tumble][@tumble1999] I have learnt markdown, [GitHub] and [Jekyll] through such programs as [Atom]. 
This is a basic, simplistic website that serves as a testing basis.
